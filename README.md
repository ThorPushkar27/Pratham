Steps to Run:  Ask about Pratham.


All the main code files are in Pratham folder.
Pratham Webscrapping folder has only codes which I have used to scrap data from the website: http://Pratham.org

Make sure all packages and LLM(llama3) is installed in your system.
Then Run app.py file. All the dependent files like style.css and script.js should be saved before you run app.py.
Open the link generated in the terminal in your browser.
